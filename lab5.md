# Lab Report 5

## Reflection
Before I began studying computer science, I would see my older brother on Github all the time. I even downloaded some code from Github to mod some videogames, without really knowing what it was. What I did know was that it was something for coding people. The second half of the quarter taught me things that made me feel like one of those people. Although I'm sure the topics we covered are super basic and hardly scratch the surface, I can now call myself a programmer without any reservations. No longer do I have to type in my password like some plebian, because I know what bash is and I can write a script to do it for me without compromising secuirty.
