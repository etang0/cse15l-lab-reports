# Lab Report 5

## Reflection
Before I began studying computer science, I would see my older brother doing things on Github all the time. Somtimes I would download code from Github to mod videogames, but I didn't really know what it was. What I did know was that it was something for coding people. The second half of the quarter taught me things that made me feel like one of those people. Although I'm sure the topics we covered are super basic and hardly scratch the surface, I feel like I can call myself a programmer without any reservations. No longer do I have to type in my password like some plebian, because I know what bash is and I can write a script to do it for me. In the first half of the quarter I wrote a bootleg script that had my actual password written out, but now I've upgraded to a secure version which utilizes private/public key encryption. After learning about Github and git commands, I think I would be able to understand all that stuff I saw my brother doing. And now that I know the basics; fork and clone, add and commit, push and pull, I can collaborate with other people. Whether it's fellow students or internet strangers, we can exchange code and give back something new and improved. I don't even have to open a code editor, since I can make changes directly from the terminal with vim. Knowing my way around the command line and common fixtures in programming makes me feel more prepared for the upper division classes next year.
